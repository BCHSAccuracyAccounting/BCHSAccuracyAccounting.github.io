				<h3><a id="R1">Job Availability</a></h3>
					<p class="body_text">There are so many different ways to find available jobs, more than could be mentioned on here, ranging from word-of-mouth to online postings, and many things in between, such as your local newspaper, or a sign in a store window that says "Now Hiring".  These two will likely be the easiest way to find a job if you have little to no experience.</p>
					<p class="body_text">Regarding the online job postings, listed below are websites to make it easier to see all the online postings, but you can also post your resume   on the internet for employers to view. This may be less likelyway to find a job though, as the employer would have to find your resume on the site, so presenting it to them on one of the websites below will be more successful.</p>
					<p class="body_text">A couple of these websites are:</p>
					<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="https://www.monster.com" target="_blank">Monster.com</a>&quot;</p>
					<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="https://www.indeed.com" target="_blank">Indeed.com</a>&quot;</p>
				<h3><a id="R2">Find the Right Job</a></h3>
					<p class="body_text">It can be confusing to jump right into finding a job, but there are many resources available online to help you narrow your choices, one of these is an interest inventory at &quot;<a href="https://www.123test.com/career-test/">123test.com</a>&quot; to help you decide what job is right for you.</p>
				<h3><a id="R3">Job Stability Rates</a></h3>
					<p class="body_text">There are plenty of sites to look at the job security of different careers. However, the information on these sites is changing constantly, due to the changes in our economy, so you must find a website that is accurate and up to date. For this reason, there are several sites listed below so that you have plenty of options in choosing the one that you trust, or even take the information on all of them into consideration to get the most accurate data that you can. </p>
					<p class="body_text">However there are a few websites that have done recent studies regarding the stability on various jobs.</p>
					<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="https://study.com/articles/careers_with_job_security.html" target="_blank">Study.com</a>&quot;</p>
					<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w4859" target="_blank">nber.org</a>&quot;</p>
					<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/high-paying-secure-jobs" target="_blank">Monster.com</a>&quot;</p>
		  <h3><a id="R4">Average Income for different Jobs</a></h3>
		  			<p class="body_text">The amount of money that you make from a particular jobcan greatly influence the career you choose, there are websites that find the average amount of income a particular career will bring in.</p>
		  			<p class="body_text">&quot;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2016/may/oes_nat.htm#00-0000" target="_blank">bls.gov</a>&quot;</p>
				<h3><a id="R5">Job Networking</a></h3>
					<p class="body_text">When looking for a job it can be helpful to be well known in the community especially when starting a career. However, if you are not a local to the area in which there is job availability, it can be helpful to create a professional online profile. This online profile can help potential employers look at your resume and achievements. This can help them make a decision on whether or not you are the right person for the job.</p>
					<p class="body_text">One such website is a site known as &quot;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">linkedin</a>&quot;, on this website you can create your professional profile and communicate with potential employers or vice versa, they may reach out to you if you're profile is attractive enough.</p>
				<h3><a id="R6">Proper Dress</a></h3>
				<p class="body_text">The type of dress that you should wear varies for what type of job you are applying for. However, for most jobs it is generally standard to wear some kind of slacks, a button up shirt and a tie.</p>
				<p class="body_text">It is a pretty good rule of thumb to just follow business standards for dress. A very good list of business attire, and what is appropriate can be found on the FBLA-PBL website.</p>
